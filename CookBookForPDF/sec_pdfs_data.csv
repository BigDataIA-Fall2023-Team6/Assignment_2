If the proposed rule change amends an existing rule, state whether that existing rule, as amended by the proposed rule change, will impose any burden on competition.  If any impact on competition is not believed to be a "
19b-4,Jan. 2013,SEC1832,Self-Regulatory Organizations,"significant burden on competition, explain why. Explain why any burden on competition is necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. In providing those explanations, set forth and respond in detail to written comments as to any significant impact or burden on competition perceived by any person who has made comments on the proposed rule change to the self -regulatory organization.  A mere assertion that the proposed rule change "
19b-4,Jan. 2013,SEC1832,Self-Regulatory Organizations,satisfies these requirements is not sufficient.  The statement concerning burdens on competition should be sufficiently detailed and specific to support a Commission finding that the proposed rule change does not impose any unnecessary or inappropriate burden on competition.  Failure to describe and justify the proposed rule change in the manner described above may result in the Commission not having sufficient information to make an affirmative finding that the  proposed rule chan ge is consistent with the Act and the rules and regulations issued thereunder that are

The Commission will generally exercise its summary power under Section 19(b)(3)(B) on condition that the proposed rule change to be declared effective summarily shall also be subject to the filing procedures of Section 19(b)(1) of the Act, for approval pursuant to Section 19(b)(2).

Similarly, the Commission requires that any proposed rule change which has taken effect upon filing pursuant to paragraph (B)(II) of Rule 19b- 4(f)(4)(ii) shall also be subject to the filing "
